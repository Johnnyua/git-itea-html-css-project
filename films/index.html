                            The Fast and the Furious is a 2001 action film directed by Rob Cohen from a screenplay by Gary Scott Thompson, Erik
                            Bergquist, and David Ayer, with the story credited to Thompson. It is the first installment in the Fast & Furious
                            franchise and stars Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Rick Yune, Chad Lindberg, Johnny
                            Strong, and Ted Levine. In the film, Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop, is tasked with discovering the identities of a
                            group of automobile hijackers led by Dominic Toretto. Preparations for The Fast and the Furious began after Cohen was
                            introduced to illegal street racing in May 1998,[citation needed] with the screenplay originally developed by Thompson
                            and Bergquist; Walker and Diesel were cast in late 1999, and Diesel contributed to script rewrites with Ayer as the rest
                            of the cast was finalized.[4] The production attended illegal street races, and is notable for its inclusion of street
                            racers. After setting an initial release date for March 2001, principal photography began in July 2000 and lasted until
                            that October,[5] with filming locations including Los Angeles and southern California.[6] The Fast and the Furious was
                            theatrically released in the United States on June 22, 2001, by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from
                            critics, many of whom praised the performances of Walker and Diesel and the action sequences,[7][8] but criticism for
                            its storyline and the ending.[9] The film grossed over $200 million worldwide, becoming the 19th highest-grossing film
                            of 2001. It launched a franchise starting with the sequel film 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), which then led to an industry of
                            tie-in products, including video games, amusement park attractions, and spin-off works, and merchandise including toys
                            and clothing. The Fast and the Furious was reissued in a limited release in June 2016, to commemorate its fifteenth
                            anniversary.

                            Car thief Kip Raines works with his gang to steal fifty high-end cars for Raymond Calitri, a British gangster in Long
                            Beach, California. After stealing a Porsche 996 from a showroom, Kip unwittingly leads the police to his crew's
                            warehouse, forcing the thieves to flee. Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff impound the stolen cars and open an
                            investigation. Atley Jackson, Calitri's associate, reaches out to Kip's older brother Randall "Memphis" Raines, a
                            notorious but reformed car thief. Memphis meets with Calitri, who has kidnapped Kip and intends to kill him in a car
                            crusher. Memphis agrees to steal the fifty cars within 72 hours, and Kip is released; Calitri warns that if the cars are
                            not delivered on time, Kip will be killed.
                            
                            Memphis visits his mentor Otto Halliwell and they assemble a crew of old associates: Donny Astricky, now a driving
                            instructor; Sphinx, a mute mortician; and Sara "Sway" Wayland, a mechanic and bartender. Kip and his crew volunteer to
                            help, and the group tracks down the cars, giving each a code name; Memphis insists on saving a 1967 Ford Shelby GT500,
                            dubbed "Eleanor"—which he has attempted to steal before—for last. While scouting the cars, he and Kip narrowly avoid
                            being killed by a rival gang. Hoping to deliver the cars before they can be traced, the crew plans to steal all fifty
                            cars in one night.

                            MI6 operative James Bond gains his license to kill and promotion to 00 agent status by assassinating two targets:
                            traitorous section chief Dryden at the British Embassy in Prague and his contact, Fisher.
                            
                            In Uganda, the mysterious Mr. White introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the Lord's Resistance Army, to Le
                            Chiffre, an Albanian private banker to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money to invest; Le
                            Chiffre subsequently shorts the stock of aerospace manufacturer Skyfleet, betting on the company's failure given his
                            insider knowledge of a terrorist attack.
                            
                            In Madagascar, Bond pursues bomb-maker Mollaka to an embassy, killing him and blowing up the building. In London, MI6
                            chief M admonishes Bond for causing an international incident and ignoring her orders to capture Mollaka alive. Clues
                            point to corrupt Greek official Alex Dimitrios, whom Bond finds in the Bahamas. After winning his Aston Martin DB5 in a
                            poker game and seducing his wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami and kills him. Bond then thwarts the
                            destruction of Skyfleet's prototype airliner, costing Le Chiffre his entire investment: $101.206 million in total. He
                            surmises that "somebody talked" and since Dimitrios was already dead, his wife Solange is tortured to death for
                            information on the alleged leak.
