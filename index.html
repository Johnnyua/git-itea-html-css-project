                            Anyone who's watched 2001's <a href="./films/index.html#film_fastfurios">"The Fast and the
                                Furious"</a> has likely always wondered one question: did Brian's <a
                                href="./cars/index.html#cars_cupra">Toyota Supra</a>
                            or Dominic's <a href="./cars/index.html#cars_charger">Dodge Charger</a> win the final drag
                            race?

                            Thankfully, "Fast and Furious" expert Craig Lieberman has an explanation. Lieberman was the
                            chief technical director for
                            the first two movies and has loads of inside knowledge about the cars used for filming. For
                            this question, there are
                            three schools of thought.

                            The first is to take each hero car on paper and see how they match up. The engine supposedly
                            in the 1970 Charger was a
                            526-cubic inch supercharged V-8 running alcohol to make around 900 horsepower. The Supra
                            featured a standard 2JZ
                            inline-6 with a T-66 turbocharger. Lieberman estimates the weights of both cars to be 3,900
                            pounds for the Supra
                            (remember, it had a lot of "tuner" stuff not meant for drag racing) and 3,600 pounds for the
                            Charger. Also recall the
                            Supra had a wet shot of nitrous that, best case scenario, helped it make 800 hp.

                            Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie and the film, which was released almost two decades ago in
                            2000,
                            was a remake of the 1974 flick. The acting may not have been worthy of an Oscar nod, nor the
                            film itself, but there was
                            the car – a 1967 <em>Ford Mustang</em> which turned heads. It was glorious, boasting a style
                            that people still covet today. Not
                            surprisingly, the car featured in the film has been credited with helping to popularise the
                            automotive trend of
                            retromodding vintage cars, and even revived the <a

                            The <a href="./cars/index.html#cars_db5"><em>DB5</em></a> debuted in Goldfinger and has
                            since made appearances in Thunderball (1965), GoldenEye
                            (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), The World is Not Enough (1999), <a
                                href="./films/index.html#film_casinoroyal">Casino Royale (2006)</a>, SkyFall (2012),
                            Spectre (2015), and No Time to Die. The car fits the franchise’s timeless aesthetic,
                            Reichman argues, but it also carried
                            practical traits that went beyond style. When Aston released the DB5 in 1963, the company
                            was highly successful in
                            sports car racing, including a 1959 victory with the DB1 at Le Mans. The DB5 was essentially
                            a stunt vehicle before it
                            arrived on the Bond set. “The original DB5 had to be able to properly drive through corners
                            [and overtake] a Ferrari in
                            the Alps,” Reichman says. “People see that and it becomes part of the story, that this
                            vehicle is a reliable tool for
                            James Bond to do his job.”
