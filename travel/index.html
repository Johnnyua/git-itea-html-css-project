                            If you have got a car, there are plenty of benefits. One of them is the possibility to travel with it. However, there
                            are still some people who are not eager to go anywhere by own car. So, let’s consider the main advantages of traveling
                            in this way.
                            
                            Those who prefer not to go far by own car are usually afraid that something may happen on the way and they won’t be able
                            to call the service to quickly arrive to help. Well, having the best tool backpack in the trunk with everything you may
                            need may eliminate the need to call the service. Another solution is to have your car thoroughly checked before the
                            trip. In such a way, you can be calm and have no worries about the condition of a vehicle you are driving. Here are the
                            key reasons why traveling by car is so much beloved by millions of car owners.
                        </div>
                            
                            <ul class="main-content-travel-title-list">
                                <li>
                                    You are free to choose and change your route: using public transport, to get to the destination, it may be needed to
                                    make several transfers. While going somewhere by car, you will reach the destination. Besides, if you decide to visit
                                    one more place, there is no problem at all. With a car, you are as flexible as your budget and timing allow you.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You do not have to follow someone’s schedule: traveling in a small group, it is easy to find a compromise and decide
                                    to stop or make a longer pause for rest, etc. When you are on a tour bus, everything should be done according to the
                                    schedule, even going to a bathroom. If you have liked a view of the sunset, you can stop your car and take pictures.
                                    This is hardly possible if you are traveling by bus.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                     You spend less money on nutrition and trip: no matter how low-cost a bus is, it is still cheaper to pay for gas only.
                                    Besides, you will have the possibility to eat in cafes that are remote from the main roads, therefore, are cheaper.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You may take as much stuff as your trunk can accommodate: on the contrary to the public transport where luggage is
                                    strictly limited.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                Accommodation possibilities are wider: it is possible to rest a villa or apartment and there will be no problem to
                                get there.
                                
                                In any case, the choice of transport means depends on what a person likes. If you are not fond of driving, there are
                                plenty of alternatives available.
