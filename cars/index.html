                            The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by
                            Toyota
                            Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to
                            surpass" or
                            "go beyond".
                    
                            The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been
                            produced since
                            March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota
                            Celica, but it
                            was both longer and wider. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn,
                            Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car Supra. Owing to the similarity and past of the
                            Celica's
                            name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the
                            Supra were
                            assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant
                            in
                            Toyota City. The fifth generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna
                            Steyr.

                            The Dodge Charger is a model of automobile marketed by Dodge in various forms over seven generations since 1966.
                            
                            The first Charger was a show car in 1964. A 1965 Charger II concept car had a remarkable resemblance to the 1966
                            production version.
                            
                            The Charger has been built on three different platforms in various sizes. In the United States, the Charger nameplate
                            has been used on subcompact hatchbacks, full-size sedans, muscle cars, and personal luxury coupes. The current version
                            is a four-door sedan.
                            The 1966 Charger was an effort by Dodge to produce an upscale, upsized pony car. American Motors had already built a
                            very similar vehicle in 1965, the Marlin, which was positioned as a personal car, an emerging market niche.
                            
                            Mercury was more successful in its execution in introducing the upscale Cougar, which was both considerably larger and
                            more refined than the Ford Mustang that pioneered the pony car concept in 1964 - yet still had badly compromised rear
                            seating.
                            
                            The Charger was intended to up the ante to an even more expensive and luxurious coupe that featured all-bucket seating
                            for four.

                            The first-generation Ford Mustang was manufactured by Ford from March 1964 until 1973. The introduction of the Mustang
                            created a new class of automobile known as the pony car. The Mustang’s styling, with its long hood and short deck,
                            proved wildly popular and inspired a host of competition.
                            
                            It was initially introduced on April 17, 1964, as a hardtop and convertible with the fastback version put on sale in
                            August 1964. At the time of its introduction, the Mustang, sharing its platform with the Falcon, was slotted into a
                            compact car segment.
                            
                            With each revision, the Mustang saw an increase in overall dimensions and in engine power. The 1971 model saw a drastic
                            redesign to its predecessors. After an initial surge, sales were steadily declining, as Ford began working on a new
                            generation Mustang. With the onset of the 1973 oil crisis, Ford was prepared, having already designed the smaller
                            Mustang II for the 1974 model year. This new car had no common components with preceding models.

                            The Aston Martin DB5 is a British luxury grand tourer (GT) that was made by Aston Martin and designed by the Italian
                            coachbuilder Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera. Released in 1963, it was an evolution of the final series of DB4.
                            
                            Although not the first in the DB series, the DB5 is the best-known cinematic James Bond car, first appearing in the
                            James Bond film Goldfinger (1964).
                            The principal differences between the DB4 Series V and the DB5 are the all-aluminium engine, enlarged from 3.7 L to 4.0
                            L; a new robust ZF five-speed transmission (except for some of the very first DB5s);[5] and three SU carburettors. This
                            engine, producing 282 bhp (210 kW), which propelled the car to 145 mph (233 km/h), available on the Vantage (high
                            powered) version of the DB4 since March 1962, became the standard Aston Martin power unit with the launch in September
                            1963 of the DB5.
                            
                            Standard equipment on the DB5 included reclining seats, wool pile carpets, electric windows, twin fuel tanks, chrome
                            wire wheels, oil cooler, magnesium-alloy body built to superleggera patent technique, full leather trim in the cabin and
                            even a fire extinguisher. All models have two doors and are of a 2+2 configuration. The boot lids differed slightly
                            between the DB4 mark 5 and the DB5.
                            
                            Like the DB4, the DB5 used a live rear axle. At the beginning, the original four-speed manual (with optional
                            overdrive) was standard fitment, but it was soon dropped in favour of the ZF five-speed.[5] A three-speed Borg-Warner DG
                            automatic transmission was available as well.[8] The automatic option was then changed to the Borg-Warner Model 8
                            shortly before the DB6 replaced the DB5.
